## Task 01 - Hello World

Here we are. Our journey with React just started and we are about to learn the sh\*t out of it. We have our basic file structure set up, thanks to `create-react-app` and we will dig in to our first task.

**Story**
We will create a simple todo app. We will build all the functionalitis from scratch so the users can be able to add new todos, check and uncheck todos as done and delete them.

**TODO**:

In this task we would like to:

1. Explore the folder structure and the javascript files. What's the entry point of our app? What is this funky html called [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)?
2. Let's try to print Hello World to our app, instread of the default message from React.
3. Let's get rid of what we don't need like unused images.
4. I don't see any .scss files around. Let's add one.
